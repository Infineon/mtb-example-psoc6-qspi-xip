# PSoC 6 MCU: External Flash Access in XIP Mode

This example demonstrates how to use QSPI block of the PSoC 6 MCU in execute-in-place (XIP) mode with an external flash memory device using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox™. At device reset, the default Cortex-M0+ (CM0+) application enables the CM4 CPU and configures the CM0+ CPU to go to sleep. The CM4 CPU uses the QSPI resource in XIP mode to access a function and a string that is programmed into the external memory. A UART resource prints status updates as the program executes.

## Hardware Setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note**: The PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software Setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

## Using the Code Example

### In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:

1. Click the **New Application** link in the Quick Panel (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**).

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the **Library Manager** to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, right-click the application name from the Project Workspace window in the IDE, and select **ModusToolbox** > **Library Manager**. You can also access it from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example.

4. Optionally, update the **Application Name:** and **Location** fields with the application name and local path where the application is created.

5. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*.

### In Command-line Interface (CLI):

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.
2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder. 

On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, navigate to the modus-shell directory (*{ModusToolbox install directory}/tools_\<version>/modus-shell*) and run *Cygwin.bat*.

3. Import the required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

### In Third-party IDEs:

1. Follow the instructions from the CLI section to download or clone the repository, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.
2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mtb_user_guide.pdf*.

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board.

   - **Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox**:

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3)**.  

   - **Using CLI**:

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. 
     
     You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```

      **Note**:  Before building the application, ensure that the *deps* folder contains the BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.lib*) corresponding to the TARGET. Execute the `make getlibs` command to fetch the BSP contents before building the application.  

7. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that **PSoC 6 MCU QSPI Flash XIP** is displayed on the UART terminal.

8. Observe the User LED to determine the status of the external memory access:

   - LED is blinking: Successful operation
   - LED is always ON: Failed operation

9. Verify that the debug messages appearing in the terminal window are as shown in Figure 1:

**Figure 1. Serial Terminal Output**

![Figure 1](images/serial_terminal.png)

11. If you see an error message in the terminal, reset the device using the SW1 RESET button on the kit and observe the output again.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*.

## Design and Implementation

### Resources and Settings

This example uses the QSPI hardware block for interfacing with the external memory through four data lines and one slave select line. During programming, an array and a function are placed into the external memory section using the section attribute *CY_SECTION(".cy_xip")*. This data is then loaded into the external memory during the programming process. The UART resource outputs debug information to a terminal window. A user LED indicates the status of the read and write operation. A blinking LED indicates successful execution and a solid LED indicates an error in execution. 

This example uses the [serial-flash](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/serial-flash) library along with the memory configuration provided as part of the BSP. This configuration can be changed using the QSPI Configurator tool. See the files *cycfg_qspi_memslot.c* and *.h* in the */libs/{target kit directory}/COMPONENT_BSP_DESIGN_MODUS/GeneratedSource* directory for the specific memory configuration used with this example.

The [serial-flash](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/serial-flash) library includes the source file *cy_serial_flash_prog.c*, which contains structures that allow the external memory to be programmed during the device programming process. By default, these structures are not enabled. To enable the use of the structures, open the Makefile and add CY_ENABLE_XIP_PROGRAM to the DEFINES. You can add multiple macros to the DEFINES separated by a space.

Section type conflicts may arise if you attempt to program data into the same section as executable functions in the external memory. To resolve this, a section of external memory named .cy_xip_code is added to the linker file qspi_xip_app.ld. This section is used for storing executable code in external memory.

    .cy_xip_code :
    {
        KEEP(*(.cy_xip_code))
    } > xip 
Note that the linker file qspi_xip_app.ld is configured for use with a PSoC 6 device with 512 KB of flash.  If you are using a device with more flash memory, you can replace the contents of the memory section of qspi_xip_app.ld with the correct memory sizes for your device. 

The following ModusToolbox resources are used in this example.

**Table 1. Application Resources**

| Resource  |  Alias/Object     |    Purpose     |
| :------- | :------------    | :------------ |
| QSPI (HAL) | qspi_obj                | QSPI HAL object used by serial-flash library for QSPI communication |
| UART (HAL)|cy_retarget_io_uart_obj| UART HAL object used by Retarget-IO for Debug UART port  |
